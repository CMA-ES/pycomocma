``pycomocma`` is a Python implementation of [COMO-CMA-ES](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02103694/document) which is a Multiobjective Evolution Strategy, based upon the [Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES) 
([CMA-ES](http://cma.gforge.inria.fr/)) single optimizer.

For the time being, only the bi-objective case is tested and functional.
